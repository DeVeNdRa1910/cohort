Thing to learn
  # RecoilRoot -> 
  # atom
  # selector
  # useRecoilState
  # useRecoilValue
  # useSetRecoilState

  like -> [state , setState] = useState(0);

  function same as useState we have in Recoil 
  useRecoilValue same as state
  useSetRecoilState same as setState
  useRecoilState it will give array of both useRecoilValue and useSetRecoilState

  we can assume like this.
  [useRecoilValue , useSetRecoilState] = useRecoilState();
