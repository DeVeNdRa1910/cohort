ts code runs never on Browser . Browser can only understand javascript
  -js is runtime language
  -ts is something that compiles down to javascript
  - when ts is compiled down to js , you get type checking If there is an error the conversion to js fails
  - Onec ts is compiled down to js then it can be run anywhere node or Browser

npm install -g typescript
npm init -y
npm tsc --init

after writing ts code we have to compiled it to js byt ( tsc -b ) 
then you have a js file with same code concept do not need about what code write in js file


-> rootDir and outDir are nothing but better folder structure
we are creating two folder src and dist(distribution or build) inside src we creating ts files and in dist folder compiled js file are present
we have to change directory in tsconfig.json file
// ye karne ka fayda ye hai ki we can include dist folder in gitignore
